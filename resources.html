            <h2>First Interview</h2>
            <p>Sophie was bullied in school, and it had a profound impact on her life as an adult. Here is her story:
            <p></p>
            Sophie was a shy and introverted child who struggled to make friends.
            She was often the target of bullying, with other kids making fun of her clothes, her glasses, and her quiet demeanor. The bullying continued throughout her school years, and Sophie became increasingly isolated and withdrawn.

            <p></p>She struggled with anxiety and depression, and her grades suffered as a result. As an adult, Sophie still struggles with the effects of the bullying. She has low self-esteem and finds it difficult to trust others. She has trouble making friends and often feels like an outsider.

            <p>However, Sophie has also found ways to cope with her experiences. She has sought therapy to work through her trauma and has found support in online communities of other bullying survivors. She has also become an advocate for anti-bullying initiatives and works to raise awareness about the long-term effects of bullying. Sophie's story is a reminder that the effects of bullying can last a lifetime. It's important to take bullying seriously and to provide support and resources for those who have experienced it.

            <h2>Second Interview</h2>
            <p>Here is an interview that we all could relate to from one time to another, ourselves. We may or may not know that we are our own bullies but yes it can happen! Here is our story:
            <p></p>
            Have you ever been told something that's not true, like those clothes look ugly on you, or what is that hairstyle ect. Then you try and change because of them and repeat what they said to your self hundreds to thousand of times to the point you can change mental or physical appearance. This is knows as self bullying and it affects people all over the world.

            <p>One time I heard someones talking about someone and realised that the person didnt know that they were talking behind their back, after a bit they changed bit by bit just to be friends with that person. I realized that we don't need to compare ourselves to others because we are each individually different in our own ways. Don't listen to those who don't like or agree with your decisions. Don't let them affect them like Sophie.

            <h2>Fictional Senerio</h2>
            <p>Scenario: Sarah, a new student, is being bullied by a group of classmates during lunchtime. They make fun of her clothes and call her names.

Dialogue:
<br><br>
Sarah: looking upset Why are you guys being so mean to me? I haven't done anything to you.
<br><br>
Bully 1: Oh, come on, Sarah! We're just joking around. Can't you take a joke?
<br><br>
Sarah: It doesn't feel like a joke to me. It hurts my feelings when you make fun of me.
<br><br>
Bully 2: Well, maybe if you dressed better, we wouldn't have to make fun of you.
<br><br>
Friend: steps in Hey, that's not cool. Sarah has the right to dress however she wants, and it's not okay to make fun of her for it.
<br><br>
Sarah: Thank you for standing up for me, but I don't know what to do. It's making me really sad.
<br><br>
Friend: It's important to remember that bullying is never your fault. You should talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher or counselor, about what's happening. They can help you address the situation.
<br><br>
Sarah: But what if they don't believe me or think I'm overreacting?
<br><br>
Friend: It's possible that some adults may not fully understand the situation, but it's important to keep trying until you find someone who listens and takes action. You deserve to feel safe and supported at school.
<br><br>
Sarah: Okay, I'll try talking to a teacher. Thank you for being there for me.
<br><br>
Friend: Of course, Sarah. Remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you.
<br><br>
<br>
In this scenario, the dialogue emphasizes the importance of standing up against bullying, supporting the victim, and seeking help from trusted adults. It encourages open communication and empowers the victim to take action.
